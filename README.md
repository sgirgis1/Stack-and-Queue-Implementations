Developed and tested four java classes for stack and queue data structure implementations. 
1. An array-based stack abstract data type (ADT) class that implements the provided StackInterface.java
2. An array-based queue ADT that implements the provided QueueInterface.java
3. An ArrayList-based stack ADT that implements the provided StackInterface.java
4. An ArrayList-based queue ADT that implements the provided QueueInterface.java

The classes were developed to be generic and include a toString() method:
* The stack's toString( ) return value must list the items in the stack in order from top to bottom, and include linefeeds to produce a vertical display 
* The queue's toString( ) return value must list the items in the queue in order from front to rear, with no linefeeds between queue elements
